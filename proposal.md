# Project Description

Explain what I'm going to build here

Making a fishing game, different spawn rates, different rods, abilities to be able to reel in faster and such

## Needs to Have list

- Punching fish to catch, fish fights back, spam
- Making a grid to drop a square while using a square, if misses fish punches you and you start to lose the catch, if you dont miss, you start catching the fish more
- Fish catching bar
- Need certain upgrades to be able to fish for stronger fish
- Ofishuary, when a is caught it will show up in the Ofishuary

## Nice to Have List

- Make a sweet spot for casting 
- Multiple worlds
- Chances of catching a fish in certain areas goes up and new ones spawn the further you're able to go out
- Different rods 
- Chances of getting certain fish in a certain area
- Screen able to move from left or right and showing new stuff that the screen cant fit when moving on the boat
- Making a casting state, where you can look from side to side and can see a bit further out
